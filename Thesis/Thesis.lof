The leftmost two columns show the top 4 principal components (explaining over 87\% of the variance in total) and the corresponding independent components computed using extended Infomax ICA. The remaining columns show the weights learned by the convolutional auto-encoder for all subjects combined (third column) and all individual subjects labeled P01 to P14 accordingly. Numbers below the plots refer to the percentage of explained variance for principal components and the normalized biases for the filters of the convolutional auto-encoder respectively. Noisy EEG channels that were removed and interpolated are marked by red X?s. For subjects P09 to P14, mastoid channel referencing was applied. Values at the bottom of each column refer to the mean squared reconstruction error (MRSE) per sample. \relax }}{11}{figure.caption.48}
