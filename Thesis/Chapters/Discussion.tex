\begin{enumerate}
\item Re-summarize what we were looking for
\item re-summarize what we found
\item why can't we interpret the neural net results
\item Why does our topography look so different from the one seen in Schaefer 2011? Her component describes similarities, ours describes differences. 
\item Imagination: we have determined what brain signals are important for classifying perception. We can now use this and apply it to data collected during music imagination.
