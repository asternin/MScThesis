\chapter{ERP Analysis}
Our first analysis of the data followed a strategy similar to the one used in Schaefer \etal \citeyear{schaefer_name_2011}.
Schaefer \etal \citeyear{schaefer_name_2011} used short stimuli (3.26s) allowing each stimulus to be repeated many times and the data to be averaged across hundreds of short trials. 
The grand average \acp{ERP} were concatenated to create one long data set and subjected to a \ac{PCA}, yielding clearly defined spatial features. 
The differences in the time courses of these components were used to classify their stimuli. 
We tried to replicate these results, using the time courses of components derived from the average of the first 3.26 seconds of each of our stimuli. 
We were unable to achieve significant classification results, likely because of our small number of stimuli repetitions.
Therefore, to preserve as much data as possible, we conducted a second \ac{PCA} using the full length of the trials as opposed to the first 3.26 seconds. 
We computed grand average \acp{ERP} for each stimulus by averaging the full length trials (excluding the cue).
We then concatenated the grand average \acp{ERP} and applied a \ac{PCA}. 
This resulted in principal components with poorly defined spatial components in \autoref{fig:components} (A and B).

Colors are interpolated based on the channel weights. The PCA was computed on {\bf A}: the grand average \acp{ERP} of all perception trials; {\bf B}: the grand average \acp{ERP} of all cued imagination trials; {\bf C}: the concatenated perception trials; {\bf D}: the concatenated cued imagination trials.}
  \label{fig:components}
\end{figure}

When we calculated grand average \acp{ERP}, some of the data was lost which could have negatively impacted the \ac{PCA} results.
To preserve as much of the data as possible, we took an alternative approach. 
All of the raw trials, rather than the averages, were concatenated to create a single, long trial that contained all of the raw EEG information.
We ran a \ac{PCA} on the concatenated raw trials. 
This produced clearly defined spatial components \autoref{fig:components} (C and D).
Except for their (arbitrary) polarity, the components are very similar across perception and imagination, which replicates the results found in \cite{schaefer_name_2011}.

To investigate how similar these components were across conditions and stimuli, we correlated the time courses of component three during perception and imagination.
We used component three as it accounted for the most variance while being most similar to a typical auditory component (peak in the fronto-central region of the topographic spatial map. 
The correlation was performed over the first three seconds because we expected the correlations to be highest near the beginning of the trial, before participants's imagination had a chance to drift too far from the cued tempo.
The highest correlations produced by this component were \textit{r}(190) = 0.40 (p$<$0.001) for ``Eine Kleine Nachtmusic'' (\autoref{fig:nachtmusic})

  \label{fig:nachtmusic}
\end{figure}
and \textit{r}(190) = 0.30 (p$<$0.001) for ``The Emperor Waltz'' (\autoref{fig:emperor}).

  \label{fig:emperor}
\end{figure}
Although these correlations seem promising for stimulus classification, the highest correlation of \textit{r}(190) = 0.52 (p$<$0.001) occurred between the imagination of Jingle Bells (without lyrics) and the perception of the Star Wars theme \autoref{fig:starjingle}.

\end{figure}
The high correlation between unrelated stimuli indicated that the component time course was not tracking the brain's unique response to each stimulus. 
Instead, it may be representative of more general auditory processing that occurred during music perception.
Because high correlations occurred between trials from different stimuli we could not use this approach to classify our stimuli.

Our inability to accurately classify stimuli using the time courses of components could be caused by recording fewer trials than Schaefer \etal \citeyear{schaefer_name_2011}.
We collected fewer trials per stimulus because the end-goal was to build a music-based BCI to be used with patients. 
We wanted to investigate the possibility of developing a BCI that would use minimal training which would reduce the risk of training fatigue in patients.
We only had 5 trials per stimulus, ranging from 6.9s to 16s, while Schaefer \etal \citeyear{schaefer_name_2011} collected 145 trials of each of their stimuli, each approximately 3s long.
